## 2D Epidemic Diffusion Simulation 

This is a 2 dimensional SI model with diffusion to neighbouring nodes. The SI model is solved using both 4'th order Runge-Kutta numerical method and Monte Carlo Simulation.


## To run the project, you will need 
1. GLFW
2. GLAD (version higher 4.3) 
3. GLM
4. C++ 14 minimum

You can clone and change as you with (maybe to SIR, SIS or SIV models).
