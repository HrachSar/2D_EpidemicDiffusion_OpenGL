## 2D Epidemic Diffusion Simulation 

This is a 2 dimensional SI model with diffusion to neighbouring nodes. The SI model is solved using 4'th order Runge-Kutta numerical method and compute shader.

This project is made only for learning purposes and for my Math Modeling final project. 

## To run the project, you will need 
1. GLFW
2. GLAD (version higher 4.3) 
3. GLM
4. C++ 14 minimum

You can clone and change as you with (maybe to SIR, SIS or SIV models).
